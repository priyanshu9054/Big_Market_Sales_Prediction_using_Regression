# Big_Market_Sales_Prediction_using_Regression
Overview

This project aims to predict sales in a big market using XGBoost regression. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate sales predictions based on historical data and relevant features.

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
train.csv: Dataset for training the XGBoost regression model.
test.csv: Dataset for evaluating the model's performance.

Big_market_sales_prediction_model.py: Python script contains the XGBoost regression model, to make predictions using the trained model and stores the trained XGBoost regression model.

README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
XGBoost
Scikit-learn

Additional Notes
Feel free to experiment with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to improve the model's performance.
